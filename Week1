##Definition of Problem

#Instructions:
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

#Response:
The problem I will be solving is to help expanding small chains of restaurants in Edinburgh to pick the most similar neighbourhoods to those they are currently serving, based on the other types of restaurants in those areas. Edinburgh is home to many well-loved small chains of restaurants and there is a trend of expansion into new areas of the city. 

##Data

#Instructions:
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

#Response:
I will be using the following data to help find the most similar neighbourhoods:
- Segmentation via natural neighbourhoods. A GeoJSON file is available here https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4082b44746eb4da8b5935be2d3a00185_27.geojson which is published by the city council.
- Density of restaurants in the neighbourhood, calculated from Foursquare location data.
- Types of restaurant in the neighbourhood, from Foursquare location data.
- Presence of other types of venues in the neighbourhood, from Foursquare location data.
